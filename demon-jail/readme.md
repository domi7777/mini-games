# [Demon Jail](https://domi7777.github.io/mini-games/demon-jail/dist/)
Welcome to demon jail!

Unfortunately, we have a breach, and some creatures are trying to escape.

Build towers and make sure no one survives!

Killing foes earn you money, which you can use to build more towers
You lose lives when a foe escapes.
